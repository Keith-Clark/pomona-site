                                    <h3>Paved Applications</h3>
                                    <p>Paved systems often fail prematurely because of progressive lateral displacement and weakening of the granular base course. TriAx Geogrid improves the overall stiffness of roadways, parking lots, taxiways, runways, aprons, intermodal facilities and other structures that support vehicular traffic, leading to enhanced performance. Improved performance of trafficked sections optimizes overall life-cycle costs by minimizing maintenance and rehabilitation intervals common to both flexible and rigid pavements.</p>
                                    <h3>Unpaved Applications</h3>
                                    <p>Weak subgrades are a common problem during the construction of haul roads, parking lots, working surfaces, staging areas, storage yards and other unpaved structures. TriAx Geogrid provides a simple solution for stiffening the granular platform and reducing subgrade stress. Enhanced constructability greatly improves site access while significantly reducing up-front costs and future maintenance.</p>

																		<h3>Economical. Environmentally friendly</h3>
																		<p>Pomona Pipe Products is a distributor of all Tensar® products including the Triton® Filter Mattress System. This was developed to address challenging underwater installations, providing a method to deploy, place and secure geotextile fabric in deep water and strong currents. A Triton® Filter Mattress features a geotextile fabric encapsulated within or attached to the bottom of a stone-filled mattress made of Tensar® Geogrid. The stone fill provides ballast weight for the fabric as well as a bedding layer for additional riprap or armor stone.</p>
                                    <p>Triton® Coastal and Waterway Systems feature a number of innovative composite marine structures used for construction applications in and around water. Triton Systems are made of advanced geogrid and geotextile materials and are designed to be integrated with available fill and/or vegetation.</p>
                                    <p>Triton® Systems are typically used for the following applications:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>Erosion control projects</li>
                                      <li>Foundations or cores for breakwaters, groins, etc.</li>
                                      <li>High-strength fills built in submerged conditions or with weak fill materials</li>
                                      <li>Channel linings and bridge scour protection</li>
                                      <li>Causeways, levees, dikes and bridge approach projects</li>
                                      <li>In situ capping of contaminated sediments</li>
                                      <li>Shore protection and sediment dewatering</li>
                                    </ul>
																		<p>Triton® Systems owe their strength and durability to Uniaxial (UX) Geogrids, Tensar’s geosynthetic reinforcement grids. These geogrids stand the test of time, performing better than other commercially available geosynthetics due to their stiff interlocking capability. We proudly distribute all Tensar® products.</p>
                                    <p>Increased hydraulic performance and constructability advantages mean the Triton® Systems can be significantly less expensive than conventional solutions such as riprap. They also conform to land contours and site configurations while resisting scour far better than rigid systems. Because our geogrids enable the Triton® Systems to resist all naturally occurring forms of chemical, biological and environmental degradation, they are often specified for salt water, industrial run-off conditions and contaminated sediment capping where other types of materials would deteriorate rapidly. Marine Mattresses are available in various styles and thickness options to meet specific project requirements.</p>
                                    <p>Triton® System Components - and their functions:</p>

																		<p>Triton® Gabions offer a durable, non-corrosive and installation-friendly alternative to conventional steel wire gabions – including those galvanized and PVC-coated. They are advantageous for a number of earth stabilization and erosion protection applications.</p>
                                    <h3>Triton® Filter Mattress System</h3>
																		<p>Triton® Filter Mattresses were designed for challenging underwater installation. They provide a deployment method to place geotextile fabric in deep water and strong currents.</p>
                                    <h3>Vegetated Reinforced Soil Slopes</h3>
																		<p>For centuries, soil bioengineering techniques have been used to protect and restore sensitive watersheds. Among its many applications, soil bioengineering sustains vegetated systems that provide erosion control with many additional benefits.</p>
                                    <h3>In Situ Capping</h3>
																		<p>The Triton® Marine Mattress™ System is a proven leader in the coastal and waterway erosion control market. Some of the characteristics that make the Marine Mattress Systems so effective for erosion control also make them effective for in situ capping of contaminated sediments. Triton Mattresses can also be configured to encapsulate alternative fill materials, such as sand, carbon or CETCO® Organoclay® materials in order to provide site specific remediation solutions for a broad range of in situ capping applications.</p>
