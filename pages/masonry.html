                                                <h3>Classic elegance. Efficient heating.</h3>
                                                <p>Rumford fireplaces are tall and shallow to reflect more heat, and they have streamlined throats to eliminate turbulence and carry away the smoke with little loss of heated room air.</p>
                                                <p>By using Rumford fireplace components distributed by Pomona Pipe Products, you can be sure that all the critical ratios are engineered for you so the fireplacewill be efficient and draw well. The builder or mason need only followthe instructions that come with the components to guarantee quality, save time, and ensure the correct Rumford design.</p>
                                                <p>Rumford fireplaces were common from 1796, when Count Rumford first wrote about them, until about 1850. Jefferson had them built at Monticello, and Thoreau listed them among the modern conveniences that everyone took for granted. There are still many original Rumford fireplaces - often buried behind newer renovations-throughout the country.</p>
                                                <p>Today, with the extensive restoration of old and historic houses and the renewed popularity of early American and classical architecture in new construction, Rumford fireplaces are enjoying a comeback. Rumford fireplaces are generally appreciated for their tall classic elegance and their heating efficiency.</p>
                                                <p>Rumford Fireplace Components make building a masonry Rumford fireplace easy for any mason. We do the design work. All you do is build the firebox out of fire brick, set the throat, damper and smoke chamber, bringing the masonry up as you go; set the first flue tile and complete the chimney and you have built the highest quality of all masonry fireplaces since 1796.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Radiant Heat</strong></p>
                                                <p>Tall and elegant, a Rumford fireplace is a very effective radiant heater. The tall shallow firebox with widely splayed side walls radiates more heat into the room.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Streamlining</strong></p>
                                                <p>Rumford streamlined the "throat" to remove those local hindrances that forcibly prevent the smoke from following its natural tendency to go up the chimney. With an intuitive understating of fluid dynamics far beyond the science of his day, Rumford created a venturi nozzle that propels the smoke and air up the chimney. By eliminating turbulence, the air stream is much easier to control and the throat opening can be reduced for maximum efficiency.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Clean Burning</strong></p>
                                                <p>The straight back and streamlined throat have a beneficial effect that Count Rumford could never have imagined. By keeping the smoke hotter further up the chimney, more particulate is burned, making Rumfords the only clean burning traditional fireplaces. Rumfords have been lab tested and meet wood burning appliance emission regulations.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Decorating</strong></p>
                                                <p>The beauty of masonry is in the infinite choices of decorating the fireplace and chimney. As with any fireplace, Rumfords can be decorated with any method and material that meets building codes. Deep surrounds block some radiant heat, and the surround should never drop below the leading edge of the throat. No matter how you decorate, you will still have an efficient heating fireplace.</p>
                                                <p><strong>Sizing</strong></p>
                                                <p>24" and 30" are ideal for dens, bedrooms of less than 200 square feet and conversions of Victorian coal or gas burning fireplaces. 36" and 42" Rumfords are suited to living rooms, dining rooms, and family rooms of 200 to 400 square feet. 48" Rumfords are for use in large rooms with tall ceilings, or as Rumford would say “Great Halls.” Fireplaces larger than 48" are often used in lobbies and lodges with large open spaces.</p>

                                                <h3>Elegant. Ornamental. Essential.</h3>
                                                <p>In order to select a chimney pot that will function properly, it is important to consider the top opening in relation to the fireplace opening, and the base dimension of the chimney pot in relation to the flue it is covering.</p>
                                                <p>The top opening of the pot should be in ratio to the fireplace opening. The chimney pot opening is often smaller than the effective area of the flue liner in order to reduce the effect of wind on the draft. Flue area is typically about 1/10 the fireplace opening area for square flues and about 1/12 for round flues. For chimney pots, this ratio is often reduced to 1/15 - 1/20.</p>
                                                <p>The base inside dimension should be nearly as large as or larger than the largest dimension of the flue the pot is being installed on. The chimney pot should not impinge on the effective area by more than 3/4 of an inch. Many other factors, such as fireplace chimney construction and house air pressure can affect proper chimney operation.</p>
                                                <p>For assistance in determining which chimney pots would suit your chimney best, contact Pomona Pipe Products. We will be happy to help you select and install your new chimney pot(s).</p>

                                                <p>Our vendors have developed components and a set of plans and instructions for the construction of these traditional ovens. Our wood fire ovens can be built along side a Rumford Fireplace or as a standalone unit in your kitchen or in your backyard. The exterior of the oven can be finished with a variety of masonry materials including brick, stone, stucco or tile.</p>
